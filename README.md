This is a simple guessing game done in Rust.
You have to guess a number between 1 and 100 inclusive and the program will tell you if you got it right or the guess was too big or was too small.

## Getting Started
If youâ€™re running macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, you can download and install rust by running the following command.

```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```

Otherwise you can use the [other installation method](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html) according to your operating system.

You can verify your Rust version by running:

```rustc --version```

and the output should be like:

```rustc 1.85.0 (4d91de4e4 2025-02-17)```

## Playing the game
Install dependencies and build the project by running:

```cargo build```

Then start the game by running the followng command:

```cargo run```

Remember to have fun while playing the game. It's never that serious. It's just a game! 

**Enjoy!**
